# Commands

## INIT

```sh
terraform init
# it download the plugins required and initializes tf
# this command is idempotent
# this is first command you run when you write configuration file, update or clone from somewhere.

terraform init -lock=false
```

## PLAN

**plan** is executed as part of apply and destroy

```sh
tf plan
# output: (PERSONAL NOTE: the color will be GREEN as we are creating the resource. Also all the **known after apply** are optional field which terraform will discover after its been apply, rest all are mandatory for example: cidr_block)
#+ resource "aws_vpc" "myvpc" {
#      + arn                              = (known after apply)
#      + assign_generated_ipv6_cidr_block = false
#      + cidr_block                       = "10.0.0.0/16"
#      + default_network_acl_id           = (known after apply)
#      + default_route_table_id           = (known after apply)
#      + default_security_group_id        = (known after apply)
#      + dhcp_options_id                  = (known after apply)
#      + enable_classiclink               = (known after apply)
#      + enable_classiclink_dns_support   = (known after apply)
#      + enable_dns_hostnames             = (known after apply)
#      + enable_dns_support               = true
#      + id                               = (known after apply)
#      + instance_tenancy                 = "default"
#      + ipv6_association_id              = (known after apply)
#      + ipv6_cidr_block                  = (known after apply)
#      + main_route_table_id              = (known after apply)
#      + owner_id                         = (known after apply)
#    }

# pass a variable files.
tf plan --var-file=prod.tfvars
```

- checks the state, to verify what is already created and whats not. it creates a .terraform folder. Its difficult if we loose that file.
- refer *0x-tf-save-state-file.md* to know more how to store state file safe and secure.

## APPLY

```sh
# apply the resource in the provider. it will also check everything using the PLAN and ask for confirmation by default
tf apply
# Output
# aws_vpc.myvpc: Creating...
# aws_vpc.myvpc: Creation complete after 1s [id=vpc-0c2e52f678cdce96e]
# Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

# will not ask for confirmation
tf apply -auto-approve

# with var files
tf apply -var-files=prod.tfvars
```

## DESTROY

```sh
tf destroy
# Output: (PERSONAL NOTE: the color will be RED as we are destroying the resources. Also all the **known after apply** are now fields which terraform will discover after its been apply are filled.)
# aws_vpc.myvpc will be destroyed
#  - resource "aws_vpc" "myvpc" {
#      - arn                              = "arn:aws:ec2:eu-west-2:611637807043:vpc/vpc-0c2e52f678cdce96e" -> null
#      - assign_generated_ipv6_cidr_block = false -> null
#      - cidr_block                       = "10.0.0.0/16" -> null

#      - dhcp_options_id                  = "dopt-2764344f" -> null
#      - enable_dns_hostnames             = false -> null
#      - enable_dns_support               = true -> null
#      - id                               = "vpc-0c2e52f678cdce96e" -> null
#      - instance_tenancy                 = "default" -> null
#      - main_route_table_id              = "rtb-0ff1fd87a0f5806d6" -> null
#      - owner_id                         = "611637807043" -> null
#      - tags                             = {} -> null
#    }

tf import aws_vpc.myvpc2 vpc-05372a0768b93f530
```

## Other commands

### FMT

```sh
# this command applies canonical format and style as well as
#Â terraform language style convention
terraform fmt
```

### VALIDATE

```sh
# validate the config files in a directory
# this command only validate configuration and no remote services - state or provider API
tf validate
```

### CONSOLE

```sh
# provides an interactive console for evaluating expression
# NOTE: state file is fetched(local or remote) when this command is executed
$ echo "1 + 5" | terraform console
## OUTPUT
# 6

### FORCE_UNLOCK

```sh
# acquire the lock forcefully.
terraform force-unlock LOCK_ID

# no manual intervention
terraform force-unlock LOCK_ID -force
```

### GET

```sh
# used to download or update the module mention in root module
terraform get
terraform get -update
```

### GRAPH and SHOW

```sh
# generate a visual representation of either a config or execution plan
# output: DOT format, which can be easily converted into image
tf graph

# Show: provide human readable output from a state or plan file.
# output: JSON format,
tf show 
```

### TAINT and UNTAINT

```sh
# marks resources, to be destroyed and recreated on next apply
# taint command will not perform any change to resource, but on the state file
# below command will taint everything
terraform taint

# The resource aws_security_group.allow_all in the module root has been marked as tainted.
$ terraform taint aws_security_group.allow_all

#The resource module.route_tables.azurerm_route_table.rt["DefaultSubnet"] in the module root has been marked as tainted.
terraform taint 'module.route_tables.azurerm_route_table.rt["DefaultSubnet"]'

# Untaint have same syntax as taint
terraform untaint
```

### REFRESH

```sh
# this will run a reconcile between actual infrastructure and state file
# if discrepancies are found, then state file will be updated.
terraform refresh

terraform refresh -var-file=prod.tfvars
```

### OUTPUT

```sh
# extract output values from state file
output "lb_address" {
  value = aws_alb.web.public_dns
}

# below command will print all the values from the state file
tf output
```

### PROVIDER

```sh
